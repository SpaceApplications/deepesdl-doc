    "This is the first part of the short curse. It will concentrate on data access and loading the data. Also this part is to get familiar with the DeepESDL platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The DeepESDL Hub Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "The DeepESDL platform is a Jupyterhub which encloses data storing and aquisition, code for processing, and the possibility for extensive plots in one single point. Collaboration and sharing is encouraged in such an environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimal Jupyter introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "You are currently looking at a Jupyter Hub. Short: A combination of interactive coding, text, equations and other outputs. It provides Jupyter Notebooks and text editors, terminals, data file viewer and interactive plottings, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Interface: menu bar, left sidebar, and main work area. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Menu bar**: File, Edit, View, Run, Kernel, Tabs, Settings, Help\n",
    "\n",
    "**Left Sidebar**: Different tabs where you can browse your files, see which tabs are open, which kernels and terminals are running, table of content, Softwares (Modules that are already installed and can be used at the cluster), extention manager\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main work area**: Documents like notebooks, images, consoles and datasets are organised in panels or tabs that can be subdivided or resized depending on your workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Jupyter Notebook, one can write and execute code, visualise data, and also share this code with others. The special feature of Jupyter Notebook is that the code and the description of the code are written in independent cells, so that individual code blocks can be executed individually. You can run a cell with the key combination `[Ctrl]` + `[Enter]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## xcube and xarray\n",
    "\n",
    "[`Xarray`](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/index.html) is a python module that ease the usage of labeled multi-dimensional (also known as N-dimensional) arrays built on [`NumPy`](https://numpy.org/). It allows fast and efficient array-computing, and provides functions for visualizations. Therefore it is very well suited to work with the Earth System Data Cube which contains a variety of climate and meteorological variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Earth system sciences, it is usually necessary to map data points in their spatial and temporal space (e.g. latitude, longitude and time). Many data formats (e.g. `zarr` or `netCDF`) allow data to be stored together with information about the dimensions and coordinates. Xarray provides two fundamental data structures to work with these data formats: DataArrays and Datasets. In the following image you can see a visual example of these structures ([source](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/user-guide/data-structures.html)): \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/_images/dataset-diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `DataArray` contains a single multi-dimensional variable and its coordinates\n",
    "- A `Dataset` holds multiple variables and (potentially) share the same coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "[`xcube`](https://xcube.readthedocs.io/en) is a frontend to guarantee fast and easy data access. It is part of the DeepESDL ecosystem and provides a wide range of useful functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DeepESDL project is ongoing and **Here write about the timeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the environment it is only necessary to load the following packages:"
