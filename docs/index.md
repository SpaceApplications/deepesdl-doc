## Introduction

Intro goes here



## User Guide

This section provides a guide for scientific users of the Agriculture Virtual
Laboratory, including both the thematic processing and exploitation subsystems,
and descriptions of the AVL-specific command-line and Python interfaces.

1.  [Exploitation subsystem: JupyterLab](guide/user-guide.md)


## Datasets

AVL provides a variety of EO data products from multiple sources (or
collections). They follow a well-defined dataset convention and are grouped
according to sensor type.

1.  [Baltic Sea](datasets/baltic-sea.md) for raster datasets


## System Architecture
