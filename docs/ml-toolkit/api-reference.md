# ml4xcube API 

## 1. plotting

The `Plotting` module provides functionality to visualize slices of data from `xarray.DataArray`. 
It facilitates the analysis of multidimensional data. The primary function in this module is `plot_slice`,

each playing a crucial role in the preparation, processing, and application of sophisticated machine learning algorithms 
to ensure accurate and efficient data imputation. he entire gapfilling process is showcased in the following jupyter notebook

### 3.1. helper.predictors

gap filling applications. This submodule focuses on extracting and processing global predictor data, such as land 
cover classifications, matching them to the corresponding dimensions (e.g., latitude and longitude) of the target data cube. 
The prepared predictor is then stored in a `.zarr` dataset, ready to be used across various gap filling applications.
If not leveraged during the gap filling process, a Support Vector Machine is trained on artificial gaps within the `Gapfiller` class.

#### Classes:
<table>
  <tr>
