# ML Toolkit Introduction

AI is becoming increasingly important in Earth observations as most parts of the Earth system are continuously monitored by sensors and AI is able to cope  with both the volume of data and the heterogeneous data characteristics. For instance, satellites monitor the atmosphere, land, and ocean with unprecedented accuracy. In course of DeepESDL, the Earth System Data Lab (ESDL) capabilities have been extended to support the application of 
machine learning (ML) methods on Earth System Data Cubes (ESDC). 

We provide three Python-based best practice Jupyter Notebooks based on a generic use case to showcase the implementation of state-of-the-art machine learning libraries on ESDCs in the DeepESDL Hub environment. 
Each Jupyter Notebook involves a self-contained workflow, markdown cells, comments and plots for user friendly application and guidance and is based on one of the three well established open source ML libraries respectively:

(1) [scikit-learn](https://github.com/deepesdl/ML-Toolkit/blob/master/src/use_case_lst_at_scikit-learn_mlflow.ipynb)\
(2) [PyTorch](https://github.com/deepesdl/ML-Toolkit/blob/master/src/use_case_lst_at_pytorch_mlflow.ipynb)\
(3) [TensorFlow](https://github.com/deepesdl/ML-Toolkit/blob/master/src/use_case_lst_at_tensorflow_tensorboard.ipynb)

Model evaluation is realized through the implementation of TensorBoard and ML Flow.
