# ML Toolkit Introduction

We focus on the extension of Earth System Data Lab (ESDL) capabilities to support the application of 
machine learning (ML) methods on Earth System Data Cubes (ESDC). 
We developed three Python-based best practice Jupyter Notebooks with a generic use case to showcase the implementation 
of state-of-the-art machine learning libraries on ESDCs in the DeepESDL Hub environment provided by EOX. 
Each Jupyter Notebook involves a self-contained workflow, markdown cells, comments and plots for user friendly application 
and guidance and is based on one of the three well established open source ML libraries respectively: 
(1) Scikit-Learn, (2) PyTorch and (3) TensorFlow. Model evaluation is realized through the implementation of TensorBoard and ML Flow.
